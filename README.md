#Spaceship Showdown
This was made for my Game Technology class. This version was completed at 2/25/2021.

In this game, you can play as either the Reklack or the Tempotera and fight against a Reklack or Tempotera. The game supports 2 players, and has a rudimentary AI system. 
The Reklack can shoot magnetic mines or a wild engine that will latch onto your opponent and make them lose control. The Tempotera can shoot missiles or travel back in time 1 second. 
Each ship has a certain amount of crew, and once a ship has no more crew, it is defeated. The ships also have battery, which is used for their attacks. Battery regenerates over time but it might be a good idea to partition it.

##Implementation
This game was made in Godot.
The sprite art was made by me in Piskel.
The font "airtoumcommodorishfont" was made by me (Airtoum) with Fontstruct.

##References
This game was heavily inspired by Star Control II.
This article by Alan Wolfe came in handy: https://blog.demofox.org/2017/10/01/calculating-the-distance-between-points-in-wrap-around-toroidal-space/
The Godot documentation was exteremely useful.
I looked at the Godot Engine Q&A a bunch.
The r/Godot Subreddit was occassionally useful.

##Future Development
I might make the AI better; there's some math that's wrong with it and it's overall very simplistic.
I would also probably add more ships to play as.
I would also finally add some tiny white squares in the background too for stars.
